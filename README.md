## 🌍 Project Overview

SwiftChain is composed of three main repositories:
1. **SwiftChain-Frontend**: Stack: Next.js + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
2. **SwiftChain-Backend**: Stack: Node.js + Express.js + TypeScript + MongoDB
3. **SwiftChain-SmartContract** *(This Repository)*: Stack: Stellar Soroban + Rust

The smart contract repository powers the **blockchain escrow system** used by the logistics platform.

## ⚠️ The Core Problem

Traditional logistics and delivery networks often suffer from:
- Lack of trust between senders and independent delivery drivers.
- High fees and delayed settlements for drivers.
- Inefficient utilization of existing transportation assets.
- Difficulties for small operators to access global or cross-border logistics economies.

## 💡 The Solution

SwiftChain creates a **shared decentralized logistics economy** by allowing existing transportation assets to participate securely in delivery operations. Transport providers include:
- Motorcycle delivery riders
- Courier agents
- Van drivers
- Truck operators
- Independent transport owners

By leveraging **blockchain escrow smart contracts**, SwiftChain protects both senders and delivery agents, ensuring goods are transported securely and payments are settled instantly upon delivery confirmation.

## 🔄 How It Works (Escrow Payment Model)

SwiftChain ensures **trustless logistics transactions** through the following workflow:

1. **Customer creates delivery request**: Sender initiates a delivery order.
2. **Payment is locked in escrow**: The smart contract securely holds the payment.
3. **Driver accepts delivery**: A driver is assigned to the task.
4. **Goods are transported**: The driver fulfills the logistics process.
5. **Recipient confirms delivery**: The recipient verifies the arrival of the goods.
6. **Escrow contract releases payment to driver**: Instant settlement on the Stellar network.

## 🤝 Financial Inclusion Benefits

The platform is built to empower individuals and small businesses, enabling:
- **Independent delivery drivers**
- **Small logistics businesses**
- **Rural transport operators**
- **Cross-border merchants**

to seamlessly participate in a global logistics economy powered by the Stellar blockchain.

## 🎯 Target Market

Our primary target audience includes:
- African logistics networks
- SME merchants
- E-commerce sellers
- Courier startups
- Transport unions
- Cross-border trade operators

## 💰 Revenue Model

SwiftChain generates revenue through the following streams:
- Escrow service fees
- Delivery commission fees
- Cross-border settlement fees
- Enterprise logistics integrations
- Premium logistics analytics

## 🏗️ Smart Contract Architecture

The SwiftChain smart contracts are the backbone of the trustless logistics protocol. They are responsible for:
- Escrow payment locking
- Escrow payment release
- Delivery verification
- Transaction settlement
- Delivery state validation
- On-chain logistics metadata

### Functional Requirements

The contract architecture supports:
- **Escrow Creation**: Lock payment when a delivery is created.
- **Driver Acceptance**: Driver accepts the delivery assignment.
- **Delivery Confirmation**: Recipient confirms package arrival.
- **Escrow Release**: Payment is released to the driver after confirmation.
- **Dispute Handling**: Escrow can be paused for dispute resolution.

### Event Emission
The contracts emit critical events for off-chain indexing:
- `delivery_created`
- `escrow_funded`
- `driver_assigned`
- `delivery_confirmed`
- `escrow_released`

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Stellar Blockchain**
- **Soroban Smart Contracts**
- **Rust**
- **Soroban SDK**
- **Stellar CLI**
- **Soroban CLI**
- **WASM smart contract compilation**
